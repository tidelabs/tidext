For enums, it creates an analogous new enum Permission with Unit variants, and implements `VariantPermission` by assigning different `PermissionValue` for each variant. The permission value is the “index” in the enum as exponent for the power of 2, thus from top to bottom 1, 2, 4, 8… Additionally, it implements `Borrow` from the new original enum to the new enum, to satisfy the trait bounds of `StrongholdP2p`."]],"mod":[["random",""],["test_utils",""]]};
